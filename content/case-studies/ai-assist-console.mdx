## Problem

Support agents were context-switching across 4 tools. Macros didn't capture edge cases, and AI suggestions were opaque.

## Constraints

- Security review required for PII redaction.
- Model cost must not exceed baseline macros by >10%.
- Ship a pilot within a quarter.

## Process

### Research

- Shadowed 8 agents across 3 shifts; mapped pain points at hand-off and macro selection.
- Ran a wizard-of-oz prototype to gauge trust in AI summaries.

<Metric value="-22%" label="AHT" /> <Metric value="+17%" label="FCR" /> <Metric value="+0.3" label="CSAT" />

### IA & Flows

- Unified "Ticket → Intelligence → Action" layout.
- Inline explainer for every AI action (why + source).

### Interaction Details

- Command-K to insert rationale-backed replies.
- Side-by-side diff for AI draft vs. agent edit.
- "Confidence chips" switch between Precise/Helpful/Brief modes.

## Usability

- 12 moderated tests; time-on-task improved 18% v2→v3.
- Key insight: trust rose when rationale fit under 140 chars.

  <p>Trust rose when rationale fit under 140 characters—transparency beats raw speed for expert users.</p>
</Callout>

## Outcomes

- Pilot (N=46 agents) hit success criteria in week 3.
- Rolled out progressive disclosure for costs; agents learned to pick lower-cost models for simple intents.

## Learnings

- Transparency beats raw speed for expert users.
- Rationale density needs hard limits to avoid skim fatigue.
