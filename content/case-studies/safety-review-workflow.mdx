<Callout intent="success">
  <p>We introduced explainability artifacts and structured handoffs that helped reviewers move faster with higher confidence.</p>
</Callout>

## Problem

Policy reviews were slow and inconsistent. Critical context lived in docs and Slack.

## Constraints

- Auditability and rationale required
- Multiple reviewers async, across time zones

## Process

<Grid cols={3}>
  <Figure src="/images/case-studies/safety-review/flow.svg" alt="Policy flow" caption="State diagram from submission to approval with handoffs." />
  <Figure src="/images/case-studies/safety-review/policy.svg" alt="Explainability" caption="Rationale bundle: prompts, evals, risk notes." />
  <Figure src="/images/case-studies/safety-review/dashboard-before.svg" alt="Before dashboard" caption="Before: ambiguous states, inconsistent fields." />
</Grid>

## IA

- Tabs: Submissions, Reviews, Policies
- Evidence section co-located with decisions

## Interaction design

- Inline diffs on model version changes
- Reviewers propose changes; policy owner approves

## Usability

<Metric value="+31%" label="Throughput" /> <Metric value="-17%" label="Decision time" />

## Outcomes

- Reduced rework and ping-pong in handoffs
- Clearer audit trails post-launch

## Learnings

- Expose uncertainty and rationale to empower better decisions.
- Tighten the loop between policy, red team, and product.
