<Callout intent="info">
  <p>Context: Growth in support volume doubled complexity across intents and tools. Our goal was to help agents resolve issues faster with higher confidence.</p>
  </Callout>

## Problem

Agents juggled 7+ tabs and had limited visibility into policy and the latest guidance. This increased time-to-answer and error risk.

## Constraints

- Security: no PII in training data
- Reliability: degraded gracefully when model latency spiked
- Time: 12 weeks to first production pilot

## Process

<Grid cols={3}>
  <Figure src="/images/case-studies/ai-tooling/journey.svg" alt="Journey map" caption="Journey map capturing intents, pain points, and leverage points." />
  <Figure src="/images/case-studies/ai-tooling/wireframes.svg" alt="Wireframes" caption="Explorations across guidance density and progressive disclosure." />
  <Figure src="/images/case-studies/ai-tooling/before.svg" alt="Before UI" caption="Before: fragmented tools, poor intent recognition." />
</Grid>

## Research

We ran 12 moderated sessions using real tickets. Key findings:
- Agents trusted concise guidance with citations
- Confidence sliders helped calibrate when to ask for help

## IA

- Unified navigation: Inbox, Insights, Policies
- Consistent slots for intent, guidance, actions

## Flows

<Figure src="/images/case-studies/ai-tooling/after.svg" alt="After UI" caption="After: a single canvas with contextual guidance and quick actions." />

## Prototypes

- High-fidelity prototype in Framer tested across 3 cohorts
- Added inline glossary and per-step guardrails

## Usability

<Metric value="-22%" label="AHT" /> <Metric value="+18%" label="Task success" />

## Outcomes

- Rolled to 300+ agents
- Reduced handoffs by 12%

## Learnings

- Make model behavior legible. Citations and top-3 alternatives improved trust.
- Show the system mental model; not just answers.
